# 🍿📊 Netflix-Database-MySQL

Welcome to the **Netflix-Database-MySQL** project! This project simulates Netflix's business operations using MySQL, including managing content production, user subscriptions, and activities.


## 📜 Overview

In this project, we designed and implemented a relational database 🗄️ for Netflix using SQL. It covers entities such as users 👤, content 🎥, genres 🎭, and more, enabling comprehensive data queries to uncover insights about user behavior and content trends.

### 🛠️ Features:

- 🎞️ **Content Management**: Manage movies, TV shows, and new arrivals.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **User Management**: Store details on user profiles, subscriptions, and payments 💳.
- 📊 **User Interaction**: Track user activity, recommendations 💡, and reports 📝.
- 🛠️ **Issue Reporting**: Manage user-submitted reports regarding technical and content issues.
- 💡 **SQL Queries**: A collection of useful SQL queries to analyze Netflix's business operations.
